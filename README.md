# PyBer_Analysis
Code Version 1.0

## Project Overview
This analysis shows the fare amount in dollars procured during January to April in 2019, also we can see the weekly performance and the trends by suburban, rural and urban cities, in this way is easy to identify when the PyBer Company get highest and lowest results. 

## Results.
 ### In the following graph we can see total fares by city type during January to April, where Urban rides (yellow line) represent the highest incoming fares and Rural (blue) represent lowest fares between $0 to $500. we also can a special high peak in 3rd week on February for each city type.

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
 ### based on the previous analysis I'd like to propose the following recommendation to Company CEO:
 
  * #### 1. Promote cellphone applications to increase the use of PyBer in rural cities with special discounts to increase the service and fares
  * #### 2. Promote special fares in travels to touristic places in suburban cities to increase the number of raids in the city 
  * #### 3. increase the promotions during January in urban cities increasing lowest trends. 
   
   Finally, feel free to take reference into the code by Py-ber.py file located in the repository "PyBer Analysis"
